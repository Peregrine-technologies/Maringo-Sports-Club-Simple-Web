## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed, such as Python, Node.js, or any other specific dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x or Node.js (depending on your backend/frontend setup)
- Virtual Environment (for Python-based projects)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Peregrine-technologies/Maringo-Sports-Club-Simple-Web.git
cd Maringo-Sports-Club-Simple-Web
````

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Python (Flask/Django):

If you're using Python, set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional, but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Node.js (React/Express):

For a Node.js-based project:

```bash
# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

The project requires several environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration values.

Example `.env` file:

```bash
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database.db  # Database name updated to 'your_database.db'
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development  # Only if you're using Node.js
```

### 4. Database Setup

Ensure your database is set up. For example, if you're using SQLite with the updated database name:

```bash
# Create the database (example)
sqlite3 your_database.db "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS members (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT);"
```

### 5. Run the application

Start the app locally using one of the following methods depending on your setup:

#### Python (Flask/Django):

```bash
python mainly.py  # Run the main application file
```

#### Node.js (React/Express):

```bash
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate port) in your browser.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it through your local server at `http://localhost:3000` or the port you've set in your `.env` file.
